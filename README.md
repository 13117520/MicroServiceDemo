# Item Management Microservice

This microservice provides APIs to manage items in a shop. It supports basic CRUD operations for items, along with endpoints for fetching items by ID, name, and other fields. The microservice is secured using API key authentication.

## Technologies Used

- Java 19
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- H2 Database (In-memory)
- Spring Security (API Key Authentication)
- Swagger (API Documentation)

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Item Management Microservice on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven (for building the project)
- Your favorite IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

### Running the Microservice

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project's root directory:
```
cd item-management-microservice
```
Build the project using Maven:
```
mvn clean package
```
Run the application:
```
java -jar target/item-management-microservice-1.0.0.jar
```
The microservice should now be up and running on http://localhost:8080.

API Documentation
You can access the Swagger UI for API documentation at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

API Key Authentication
To access the protected endpoints under /api/items, you need to include the API key in the X-API-KEY header of your requests.

Example:

sql
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/items" -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key"
Replace your_api_key with the actual API key configured in the microservice.

Endpoints

POST /api/items: Create a new item
POST /api/items/bulk: Create multiple items in bulk
DELETE /api/items/{itemId}: Delete an item by ID
PUT /api/items/{itemId}: Update an item by ID
GET /api/items/{itemId}: Fetch an item by ID
GET /api/items/search: Search items by ID, name, and other fields
GET /api/items: Fetch all items
